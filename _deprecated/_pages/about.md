Hi! I am Yixun Hu, a first-year Ph.D. student in ECE Department, Princeton University. 

Prior to Princeton, I obtained a bachelor's degree (B.Eng in EE) from Tsinghua University in 2025, where I worked with Prof. [Chen Jiang](https://web.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/jiangchen/en/index.htm). I also had a great summer working with Prof. [Zhenan Bao](https://baogroup.stanford.edu/) at Stanford in 2024.
